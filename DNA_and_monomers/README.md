Contents
--------
src - pdb file and TCL script for VMD used to create the initial STL files.

Technical details
--------
The model STL files can be created by running the get_stl.tcl script using VMD (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)
vmd -e get_stl.tcl

Combining models to be printed in a dual extruder printer is left to the userer, because it is printer specific.
